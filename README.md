## Introduction

The SWE381 Embedded System Design Lab Applications repository is a collection of applications developed by students for the SWE381 course, which covers the fundamentals of embedded system design using Arduino. These applications serve as practical examples to reinforce the concepts learned throughout the course.

Each application focuses on a specific aspect of embedded systems, such as sensors, actuators, communication protocols, and data processing. By exploring the source code and documentation provided, you can gain insights into how to design and implement embedded systems using Arduino.

## Getting Started

To get started with the SWE381 Embedded System Design Lab Applications, follow the steps below.

### Prerequisites

- Arduino IDE: Make sure you have the Arduino IDE installed on your computer. You can download it from the official Arduino website (https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/SWE381-Embedded-System-Design-Lab-Applications.git
```

2. Open the Arduino IDE.
3. Open the desired application sketch (`.ino` file) from the cloned repository.
4. Connect your Arduino board to your computer via USB.
5. Select the appropriate board and port in the Arduino IDE.
6. Upload the sketch to your Arduino board.

## Applications

This repository contains multiple applications developed as part of the SWE381 Embedded System Design Lab course. Each application is stored in a separate directory and includes the following:

- Source code: The Arduino sketch file (`.ino`) containing the code for the application.
- Documentation: A README file providing details about the application, its functionality, and usage instructions.
- Schematics: Circuit diagrams or connection diagrams illustrating the hardware setup required for the application.

Feel free to explore the applications available in this repository and use them as a reference or starting point for your own embedded system design projects.
